#lang racket

#|

This test checks:

  - if quickscript attempts to write anything to disk
    - on startup
    - on compilation
    - ...

also try:

   raco test -l tests/drracket/no-write-and-frame-leak

Caveats:
  - It may not use the right version of quickscript, i.e., quickscript-git
  - It may raise errors about duplicate labels in the Script menu (but this may be okay?)
  - It may complain about recompiling scripts (but this may be okay?)
